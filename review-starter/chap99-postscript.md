## Various applications of Voiceflow

//sideimage[Workshop-Voiceflow][40mm][side=L,sep=7mm,border=on]{

@<strong>{[Corporate workshop]}@<br>{}
We conducted a skill production experience using Voiceflow at "AI Voice Assistant / Smart Speaker Business Utilization Seminar & VUI Experience Workshop" sponsored by ISAO Corporation. At only half an hour group work, we had a quick experience of "VUI Design Sprint", from planning skills, creating happy paths, creating skills, and testing on actual machines.

@ <strong>{[Internal event]}@<br>{}
For the inside of Cyberd Co., Ltd., the Voice UI department led the company and held the “Alexa Skill Hackathon”. Some teams programmed using Voiceflow. It was impressive to see the members who usually work in game development and web content planning shine their eyes and face Voice UI seriously.

@<strong>{[Children's educational scene]} @<br>{}
We held a programming study group for parents and children at a programming class for children, "Programming ☆ Parent and Child Lab". Elementary school students could easily create voice applications with Voiceflow. Voiceflow can also learn the basics of "sequential", "branch" and "repetition", so it can be used as a learning material for programming.
